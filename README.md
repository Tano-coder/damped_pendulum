# damped_pendulum
This project is a physics simulation which solves, animates and simulates the trajectory and behaviour of a simple swinging pendulum, with gravity and air resistance acting on it. I used the standard equation of air drag for the air resistance, which acts in the opposite tangential direction.
The first part of the code animates a damped swinging pendulum, given an initial starting angle and velocity. The second part of the code draws the vector field created by the angular velocity and angle, as well as simulating the movement of the pendulum setup through the field, which was created in the first part.
It is wise to only change the initial angle and velocity in the 'variables' part, don't change the values of the constants.
